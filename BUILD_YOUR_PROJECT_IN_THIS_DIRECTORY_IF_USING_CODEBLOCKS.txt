IF YOU ARE USING CODEBLOCKS, build your project inside this folder. Add PageRank.cpp,
CSRMat.cpp, and CSRMat.h to the project and build it. Make sure to delete the main.cpp that
is automatically created by codeblocks, as it will give you a multiple definition of main error.


IF YOU USE A TEXT EDITOR, just compile all of the .cpps in the Src2 folder using the *.cpp command line option.
